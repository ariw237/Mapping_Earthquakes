# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview  
Various uses of Leaflet and Mapbox layers for mapping of geographical data using html and javascript. Starting with a simple map and working to up to single points, multiple points, lines and ultimately geographical features using GeoJSON data.
All folders are self-contained with the appropriate html, js, and css files.  
### Earthquake folders  
Earthquakes_past7days and earthquake_challenge folders make use of GeoJSON data obtained from USGS and https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates to plot earthquake data using these tools.
